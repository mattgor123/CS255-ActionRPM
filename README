For this assignment we believe we completed everything. For the animations, we have that our car continues to get more
and more damaged as he loses health. You will notice that when he gets to a lower health (~20%), he will look as though
he is all banged up. In order to lose health, try to move the player outside of the game screen. For the other animation,
we have our enemies headlights flashing on and off.

For part 2, we used the states model to create our screens. We believe we followed all of Oeter's instructions.

NOTE: Our high score does actually work! For now, your points keep moving upwards as time goes on. When you run out of health,
our game will check if your score is higher than any of the saved scores, and if so, you can enter in a name for the high score.

To run our game, go into the directory actionrpm/ and run the command "python game.py"
